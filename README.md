I'll help you develop this Audio-Birdle MVP specification into a functional web application. Let me create a comprehensive implementation that covers all the key features you've outlined.I've created a fully functional Audio-Birdle MVP that implements all the key features from your specification. Here's what I've built:

## ✅ Implemented Features

**🌍 Region Selection**
- Auto-detect location option (mock implementation ready for real geolocation)
- Manual region selection from predefined list
- Persistent storage of user's region choice

**🐦 Daily Bird Challenge**
- Deterministic daily bird selection using date-based seeding
- Each region gets different birds based on the date
- Game resets automatically at midnight

**🔊 Audio Playbook**
- Audio player with play/pause controls
- Error handling for unavailable audio files
- Integration ready for real bird call APIs

**✅ Guessing System**
- 4 multiple-choice options per day
- Up to 4 guesses allowed
- Immediate feedback (correct/incorrect)
- Guess history display

**🧮 Score & Sharing**
- Wordle-style emoji sharing format
- Native share API with clipboard fallback
- Results show attempt count and pattern

**📱 Local Storage**
- Game state persistence across sessions
- Region preferences saved
- No backend dependency

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **React with Hooks**: Modern functional components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, mobile-first design
- **Local Storage**: All data stored client-side
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for audio issues
- **Mock Data Structure**: Ready for real API integration

## 🔄 Ready for Production APIs

The code is structured to easily integrate with:
- **eBird API**: Replace `MOCK_BIRDS` with real regional bird data
- **Macaulay Library**: Replace mock audio URLs with real recordings
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Add the daily bird selection logic

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production

1. **Replace mock data** with real eBird API calls
2. **Add Cloudflare Worker** for daily bird selection
3. **Integrate real audio** from Macaulay Library
4. **Add geolocation** for auto-region detection
5. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages**

The MVP is fully playable right now with mock data and provides the exact Wordle-like experience you specified. Users can select regions, play daily challenges, make guesses, and share results!
