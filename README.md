**Audio Birdle** is a daily audio-based bird guessing game inspired by Wordle — but with birds! Listen to the daily mystery bird call and choose the correct species from four options. Built as a fully static, client-side app using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS, Audio Birdle brings the world of birdsong to your browser.

> **Alpha Notice:** This project is currently in alpha. While we strive to keep the core experience stable, expect things to evolve as development progresses!
