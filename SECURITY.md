# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The current active version is considered **alpha**. While development is ongoing, we will do our best to prioritize and respond to security concerns.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **Audio Birdle**:

- **Do not open a public GitHub issue**.
- Instead, report a [private security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Please provide as much detail as possible:

- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if applicable)

Youâ€™ll receive a response as soon as possible. We appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Scope

This project is currently a **static web app**. Potential concerns might include:

- Insecure handling of browser-local state
- Exploitable client-side scripts
- Malicious code injection or third-party asset vulnerabilities

Note that being able to find / exploit the answer of the day is not considered a vulnerability. The project works to obfuscate the answer from the client, but being that the code is all client side, the client must be able to determine the answer itself.

Thank you for helping keep Audio Birdle safe and secure!
